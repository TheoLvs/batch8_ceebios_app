    "abstract": "In the future, the use of imaging methods to quantify the progression and regression of atherosclerosis could play a strong role in the management of patients. High-resolution, noninvasive MRI may provide exhaustive 3-D anatomic information about the lumen and the vessel wall. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to characterize plaque composition and microanatomy and therefore to identify lesions vulnerable to rupture or erosion. The high resolution of MRI and the development of sophisticated contrast agents offer the promise of molecular in vivo molecular imaging of the plaque. This may aid early intervention (e.g., lipid lowering drug regiments) in both primary and secondary treatment of vascular disease in all arterial beds.",

    "title": "A Method for Environmental Evaluation of Shoreland Management Alternatives",
    "abstract": "Abstract The shore environment of the Great Lakes is complex and diverse. Implementation of shoreland management alternatives for the purpose of erosion and flooding protection has potential for various adverse effects upon the environment. Under the Canada-Ontario Shore Management Study, a method was developed to aid shoreland managers/planners in their environmental evaluation of shoreland management alternatives. Competent environmental evaluation is important for the preservation and enhancement of valuable shore resources. This paper discusses the keypoints of the environmental evaluation method. It also highlights one component of the method: the systemic approach to identification of environmental impacts. In this approach, the shore environment is compartmentalized into five spheres. A matrix system and a computer model are used to identify the direct effects arising from the implementation of given proposed management alternatives and subsequently trace the sequences of indirect effects resulting from the interaction of different processes operating within the five spheres of the environment",

    "title": "Straw incorporation and tillage for winter barley: Soil structural effects",
    "abstract": "Abstract A large-scale field experiment was conducted over four seasons on a gleysol (24% clay in topsoil) in Scotland. Conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing and shallow rotary or tine cultivation were investigated for the incorporation of straw in winter barley. Straw after harvest was either chopped or removed. Thus the residue treatments were either straw plus stubble or stubble only. Incorporation depths ranged from 0–100 to 0–300 mm. The presence of straw changed soil physical conditions after several seasons in which straw was incorporated. In the ploughed treatments, the presence of straw plus stubble decreased the average soil water content and matric potential in the topsoil in comparison to stubble only, indicating more rapid drainage. This was associated with the presence of buried straw in zones of loose soil just above plough depth and with a long-term increase in soil pore continuity related to the presence of straw residues. The presence of straw plus stubble under conventional ploughing decreased thermal diffusivities in the top 150 mm of soil in comparison with stubble only. Shallow incorporation of straw plus stubble gave higher overall strengths, bulk densities, lower water infiltration rates and poorer drainage in the topsoil than deeper incorporation. However, shallow incorporation caused an accumulation of organic matter over the first three seasons. This accumulation probably contributed to the increased aggregate stability and resistance to compaction of the top 50-mm soil layer, indicating improved resistance to erosion and to further compaction.",

    "title": "Economic values and incentives affecting soil and water conservation in developing countries",
    "abstract": "Soil is an essential input to farming. This is especially true in the poorest countries, where agricultural production is crucial to development, the livelihoods of the majority of the population depend on the primary sector, and non-labor inputs in agriculture are negligible. And yet agricultural land use in these countries often results in the degradation of natural soil fertility and reduced productivity. Soil degradation under farming also inflicts off-site costs, through the processes of erosion, sedimentation, and leaching.\n\nThe on- and off-site impacts of soil degradation are part of the social cost of agricultural production in developing countries. However, these costs are routinely neglected by farmers and public planners, due to market and policy failures that mask the full cost of degradation to society. An important task for policy analysts and decision-makers is to identify the underlying causes of excessive soil degradation, to evaluate their economic significance, and to create incentives for less destructive land-use practices. Appropriate policies can help by making the full costs and benefits of alternative land-use practices more apparent to land users. This paper addresses these issues by discussing the various economic factors that influence land degradation in developing countries",

    "title": "MODELLING MULTIPLE LAND‐ AND WATER‐USE SCENARIOS FOR THREE TYPICAL PILOT AREAS IN CRIMEA, UKRAINE",
    "abstract": "The use of GIS models for water quantity and quality modelling is indispensable for the determination of impacts of land-use changes or climate changes that are expected to approach. Southern Ukraine suffers from severe droughts, floods and soil salinisation already today. It is therefore of utmost importance to use the available water resources optimally to provide food security for the regions and to avoid loads of coastal waters. The paper reports the results of studies that were carried out on three Crimean pilot areas. These pilots comprise the whole catchments of the rivers Salgir and Pobednaya because the quite various land-uses contribute to the river water discharge in different ways. The main problems of the upper Salgir sub-basin are related to erosion and urbanisation impacts. The transfer zone and coastal areas are subject to intensive restructuring and agricultural developments, including the reconstruction and reorganisation of irrigation systems. The river Pobednaya drains a coastal area in the North-East of Crimea. Here, irrigation and drainage and additionally waste water discharges have impacts on the Sivash wetlands that increasingly cover the coastal area of the Sea of Azov. In order to solve all these problems, regional stakeholders have been invited to develop scenarios that are further evaluated by modelling exercises. Model results show the consequences of those scenarios and thus support finding the best solution.",

    "abstract": "IN the second part of Bergens Museums Aarbok for 1911, J. Rekstad publishes in German a description of the glacier region of southern Norway, accompanied by thirty-four illustrations. The paper is intended to serve as a guide to visitors, and does not discuss questions of glacial erosion or the origin of landscape-forms. The Jostedalsbrae (Fig. 1) north of the Sognefjord has a surface of 855 square kilometres, and furnishes an excellent type of the plateau-snowfield, from which glaciers fall, rather than creep, into the valleys round about. As one views a high field of this kind from a distance, the contrast with the limited snow-basins of the Alps is immediately apparent. Round about it, isolated glaciers lie in cirques, which have been no doubt carved out since the time when the main ice spread farther over hill and dale.",

    "title": "On the Early History of the Earth",
    "abstract": "According to current astrophysical models of the sun, solar luminosity has increased with time at a rate depending on the nature of the model and the “zero-age” of the sun. The determination of the earliest occurrence of running water on the earth9s surface may establish a calibration point on the luminosity curve. Our investigation of the nature and age of the oldest rocks suggests that erosion by running water occurred at least 4 billion years (b.y.) ago. Calculation of the evolution of terrestrial surface temperatures based on the most favorable solar model and current estimates of the composition of the early atmosphere indicate that either some revision of the model is necessary or that the earth and sun must be older than 4.5 and 5 b.y., respectively. The rate of weathering of bedrock and resulting erosion vary directly with temperature, atmospheric moisture content, and organic acids from vegetation. Since these all increased with geologic time, it is suggested that the rate of bedrock erosion, which would have been slow initially, must also have accelerated. If the presumption of an interaction between sedimentary load and geologic activity is correct, the duration of geosynclinal cycles should have decreased with time. The oldest rocks dated so far (about 3.5 b.y.) are pegmatites, granites, and granite gneiss complexes, all of which represent terminal processes in respective geologic cycles, the beginnings of which are inferred at about 4 b.y. ago. The presence of a substantial sialic crust at this time is indicated by the compositions of both igneous rocks and meta-sedimentary rocks. The origin of the continents is examined in the light of these geologic data and inferences, and on the assumption of an accumulation of the earth by accretion from cold, solid objects, probably in the form of whiskerlike crystals. Theories of origin of continents by segregation from the mantle cannot be reconciled with the time scale provided by calculations from the thermal history of the earth and the currently accepted age of 4.5 b.y. An alternative hypothesis according to which the continents originated by impact of extra-terrestrial material with subsequent modification by geological processes and mantle admixture is reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract : Erosion significantly impacts water quality in the environment. Training on Army bases disturbs the terrain and can be a significant cause of erosion. Many methods exist to quantify the amount of sediment in the water; however, very few methods have been developed to quantify the source of the sediment and actually measure the quantity of soil deposited in the water over long periods of time The Environmental Laboratory, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, developed an approach that measures the microtopography of the terrain and is repeatable so that successive measurements can be made and the erosion or deposition occurring can be quantified. This report describes the initial efforst and data collection for a long-term study of the soil erosion/deposition processes active at Fort Benning, GA.",
